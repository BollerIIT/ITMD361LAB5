  <h1>The Terrestrial Planets of the Sol System</h1>
  
  <p>Terrestrial planets are Earth-like planets (in Latin, terra means Earth) made up of
  rocks or metals with a hard surface â€” making them different from other planets that lack
  a solid surface. Terrestrial planets also have a molten heavy metal core, few moons, and
  topological features such as valleys, volcanoes and craters. </p>
